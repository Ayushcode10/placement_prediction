# Placement Predictor

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict whether a student will get a placement based on their IQ and CGPA scores. The model is a simple demonstration for educational purposes and is trained on a very small dataset. As such, its predictions are not highly accurate and should be used with caution.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-predictor.git
cd placement-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
