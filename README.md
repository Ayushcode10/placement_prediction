# Placement Predictor

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict whether a student will get a placement based on their IQ and CGPA scores. The model is a simple demonstration for educational purposes and is trained on a minimal Toy-dataset. As such, its predictions are not highly accurate.


You can clone the repo and make it more accurate and try new things as you like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-predictor.git
